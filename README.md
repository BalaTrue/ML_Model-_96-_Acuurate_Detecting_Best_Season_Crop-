# ML_Model-_96-_Acuurate_Detecting_Best_Season_Crop-
In this project, an optimistic attempt has been made to support farmers; with the purpose to improve their farming productivity. Additionally, for doing so, a  machine learning algorithm model with 96% accuracy is built; which can direct us, which crop will be best suitable for a specific climatic condition.
